  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>This plugin is intended to allow you to record observations of objects; a diary of your observations. Eventually, you'll be able to see icons on the screens for what objects you have entries on, and be able to fetch additional information on those objects from online resources. </p>
  <p>If you find any issues, please let me know.  Enjoy!</p>
  <h1>Hot Keys</h1>
  <p>There are several keys that allow you to use the features of this plugin.  If you are not a Mac user, replace the <em>Command</em> key with the <em>CTRL</em> key.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Command-L</dt>
    <dd>Display the main dialog.  This is where you enter your log book entries.</dd>
    <dt>Alt-T</dt>
    <dd>Displays the target configuration dialog.  In this dialog, you configure those objects you want to enter observations for.  To save an object, you need to have a name for that object.  If you are adding the selected object from Stellarium, make sure if it does not show a name, you enter one for it.</dd>
    <dt>Alt-L</dt>
    <dd>Shows this configuration dialog.  This is where you add your inventory of equipment.  Unfortunately, you must close it by clicking the close button.  I've been unable to figure out why this does not toggle the dialog open and close.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h1>Instructions</h1>
  <p>The first thing you'll want to do is to add items into the configuration dialog; this is your inventory of times.  To make a log book entry, you won't need everything in the configuration dialog, but you will need the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>observer</li>
    <li>target</li>
    <li>optic</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Everything else is optional.</p>
  <p>Once you've entered the items you want, you can add targets. Targets can be added from the currently selected object in Stellarium, or they can be added manually.  Targets must have values for the following fields:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>name</li>
    <li>right ascension</li>
    <li>declination</li>
    <li>type</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All other items are optional.</p>
  <p>Sessions are next up.  A session does not really need any of the data filled out, but you should set at least the start time. You will need to have a session to add observations.</p>
  <p>Now, to point of the plugin, observations.  If you have all of the required information from above, you can now add an observation.</p>
