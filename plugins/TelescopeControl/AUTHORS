AUTHORS of the TELESCOPE CONTROL PLUG-IN
========================================

Plug-in and GUI programming: Bogdan Marinov (bogdan.marinov84 (at) gmail.com)

This plug-in is based on and reuses a lot of code under the GNU GPL and LGPL:
 - the Telescope, TelescopeDummy, TelescopeTcp and TelescopeMgr classes
   in Stellarium's code (the client side of Stellarium's original
   telescope control feature);
 - the telescope server core code (licensed under the LGPL);
 - the TelescopeServerLx200 stand-alone telescope server core (licensed under
   the LGPL); author of all of the above - the client, the server core,
   and the LX200 server, along with the Stellarium telescope control
   network protocol (over TCP/IP), is Johannes Gajdosik.
 - the TelescopeServerNexStar stand-alone telescope server core (licensed under
   the LGPL, based on TelescopeServerLx200) by Michael Heinz.

See also the AUTHORS files of Stellarium and the Stellarium telescope servers.

The "telescope reticle" texture is the one used by Stellarium. Its author is
unknown, but it probably was someone form Stellarium's team.
