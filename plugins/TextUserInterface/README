TextUserInterface Plugin for Stellarium
=======================================

This plugin is an attempt to re-implement the 0.9.x (and earlier) TUI 
function.  The code's not pretty, so beware!

Please note, these instructions are only directly applicable to Linux.
Windows and OSX targets will probably require modification of the
CMakeLists.txt file.


TODO
====

+ i18n strings / change language function.
+ handle -ve typed values better
+ bold text for value being edited
+ non-UTC dates
+ automatic node linking via some menu object


KNOWN ISSUES
============

The DummyDialog which is used to grab the focus and prevent global GUI
actions from grabbing the key events away from the TUI is a little 
buggy...  specifically, if the user clicks somewhere, the DummyDialog 
loses focus and those global key bindings get in the way.


BUILDING THE PLUGIN
===================

0.  Install and build the SVN version of Stellarium as per the 
instructions on the Stellarium wiki:

  http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Compilation_on_Linux

1.  Set the environment variable STELROOT to the root of the Stellarium
source tree.  The Stellarium build directory is expected to be:

  $STELROOT/builds/unix 

2.  Create a sub-directory builds/unix and change into that directory.

3.  Run:

  cmake ../.. 
  make
  make install

If all goes well, the relevant files should be built and copied to your 
~/.stellarium/modules directory.
